/**
 * @brief   BSW DeathReport may contain additional data after the stack trace,
 *          e.g. self-tests status, which is not used by the TASTE applications.
 *          However, it's necessary to calculate the checksum over this data
 *          even if it's unused, to match the BSW behavior - otherwise the death
 *          report will always fail checksum check on BSW side and will never
 *          be recognized as valid, making it impossible for BSW to detect ASW
 *          crash. The amount of bytes is not constant, as it depends on the BSW
 *          tailoring, so it's left for the user to define that in Makefile.
